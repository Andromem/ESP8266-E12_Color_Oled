ESP8266-E12 Color Oled

Revision 1 of this design appears to work fine so far.

Assembly instructions

-order the board from OSH Park here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/nUYMQMXi The price for three 4 layer pcbs is $18.40
-follow the bom when ordering and hand stuffing components, solder on the oled display but do not tape it down
-connect the board to the Arduino IDE, pick the Adafruit Hazzah as the board, choose the right com port and load in the sketch. If the display works tape it down.
